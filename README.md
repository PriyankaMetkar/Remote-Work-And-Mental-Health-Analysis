# Remote Work And Mental Health Analysis Dashboard and Report
***
As a part of this project I have created two types of visualizations as listed below: 

* In first part of project I have created Visualizations using Power BI
* Second part of project consists of Visualizations and analysis using Python

## Project Overview

With remote work becoming more prevalent, it is essential to understand how it impacts employees' mental well-being. This project explores a dataset of 5,000 records collected from employees worldwide, providing insights into stress levels, work-life balance, and mental health conditions across various industries and regions. The aim is to help researchers, HR professionals, and businesses assess how remote work affects productivity, job satisfaction, and mental health.

The dataset contains key features like work location (remote, hybrid, onsite), stress levels, mental health resources, and job satisfaction, allowing for in-depth analysis of trends and patterns in employee well-being.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Remote Work and Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/remote-work-and-mental-health)
- **Records**: 5,000 employees across various industries and regions
- **Features/Columns**:
  - `Employee_ID`: Unique identifier for each employee.
  - `Age`: Age of the employee.
  - `Gender`: Gender of the employee (Male, Female, Non-binary).
  - `Job_Role`: The role the employee is performing.
  - `Industry`: The industry they work in.
  - `Work_Location`: Whether they work remotely, hybrid, or onsite.
  - `Stress_Level`: Self-reported stress level.
  - `Mental_Health_Condition`: Reported mental health condition (e.g., Anxiety, Depression).
  - `Social_Isolation_Rating`: A self-reported rating (1-5) of social isolation.
  - `Satisfaction_with_Remote_Work`: Level of satisfaction with remote work (Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied).

## Project Objectives

The project is divided into two parts: **Power BI Visualizations** and **Python Analysis**.

### Power BI Visualizations

The goal is to create visual reports to answer several key questions, including:

1. **Stress Level by Age**: Analyze how stress levels vary across age groups for different work locations.
2. **Gender and Work Satisfaction**: Explore if there are significant differences in satisfaction with remote work between genders.
3. **Industry Stress Comparison**: Compare stress levels across industries.
4. **Social Isolation by Work Location**: Investigate whether remote, hybrid, or onsite employees feel more isolated.
5. **Mental Health Condition and Job Role**: Examine the relationship between job roles and reported mental health conditions.
6. **Satisfaction vs. Stress Levels**: Assess whether satisfaction with remote work correlates with lower stress levels.
